= Grape Juice (Coming soon!)

Rails generator to creates the full structure of a 
ruby Gem, Rails Application and Plugin / Engine.

I was tired of creating a plugin with the generator and then
having to make all of the same mods all the time.

It is probably simpler now just to generate an application
and then add the plugin-specific and gem-specific code.

This generator may end up being more of a rails template
which makes it kinda pointless.
